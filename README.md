# My Personal Project for CPSC 210
# benkey
benkey is a password management tool that provides all of a users passwords in a secure vault. 
It will take in a users one password and give them access to all of their passwords, with the option of random generation, that they can use on any website or app. 
The overall goal of the project is to take all of my passwords off of cloud based platforms, and create my own local platform that I can store myself, on my laptop, desktop, or even USB. 
It plans to give the user complete control of their password management, while only having to remember one password.
## What will the application do?
My project will be a  password management tool, that helps users store all of their passwords locally.

## Who will use it?

Those with millions of passwords (such as myself) who also constantly find themselves forgetting said passwords. This tool is supposed to be a simple implementation of what companies like BitWarden do. 
## Why is this project of interest to you?
I constantly reset my passwords, and I use Google's password manager. I want something that I can control, and to store everything locally as opposed to online.
